The [Community Reinvestment Act](https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/default.htm) was enacted by congress in 1997 to encourage investment in underserved communities. The Act requires lenders record and publish data about loans on a per-community basis, specifically, Census tracts and MSAs.  The Disclosure reports record individual lender's loans for MSAs, broken out by loan value and the Median Family income of tracts. 

The [original data releases](https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/craflatfiles.htm) are difficult to use, as each year's disclosures are packages as fixed-width records with all 6 tables in a single file, requiring substantial effort to extract specific record. This data package collects the Small Business Loan origination disclosure records ( D1-1 )  for the years 2010 to 2015, inclusive.
